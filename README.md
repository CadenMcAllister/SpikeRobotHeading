# 📐 Gyro Helper

> **Note:** This repository currently contains the original React-based version of the app. The tool has since been rebuilt using **FlutterFlow** for better cross-platform support and faster development.

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Gyro Helper** is a simple mobile-friendly compass utility designed to assist with directional calibration — especially useful for **LEGO Spike Prime** robotics development. It tracks your current heading and lets you set, save, and recall reference points for consistent testing.

---

## 🤖 Built For LEGO Spike Prime Robotics

Originally created to simplify alignment and directional control during robotics projects. Whether tuning turns or testing rotations, Gyro Helper helps track heading offsets and quickly return to key angles.
